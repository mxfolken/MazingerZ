# MazingerZ
Mazinger Z Game for SEGA Saturn

Welcome to the video game "Mazinger Z Homebrew", which tries to amuse the Gamers with a 2D Arcade type interface, making use of the classic Scrolling genre of videogames from the time of the memorable 80's.

At the same time allows to make a modest tribute to the series of Japanese anime Mazinger Z, which laid the bases of the anime of Mechas.

Releases are also available on the itch.io site:
